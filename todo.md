## Timeline ( Fri Nov 21 y25 - present )

### Exam Details Page Adjustments

1. Exam level separation
    - [ ] The exams should simulate AWS's official exam pathway
    - [ ] separated to show the user where to start and where to end of

2. Exam description
    - [ ] Every exam should have its own definite description
    - [ ] The average timing should also be researched for this


### Exam Page Adjustments

1. Before the user takes the exam, Show them the rules as an official assignment would
    - [ ] The time limit
    - [ ] assurance of test environment, i.e write on a laptop, make sure internet is stable
    - [ ] pledge from user to not use any AI throughout the exam, but this should be more focused on the user's honesty to themselves. If they are cheating in practice, then what is their plan for the actual exam?
    - [ ] ... and many more you can find

2. Constraints on the exam page
   - [ ] Make sure the user cannot copy text on the page they are currently working on
